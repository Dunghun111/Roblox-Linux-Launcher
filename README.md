Forked from PJBeans/Roblox-Linux_Launcher

Change #!/usr/bin/env python -> #!/usr/bin/env python3 in order to make easy shortcut in /usr/bin

Change drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Roblox -> drlve_c/users/$USER/AppData/Local/Roblox

Make sure to support PJBeans and his contributor because they make the launcher and they are great. <3
